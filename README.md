- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that open innovation ecosystems are like potluck dinners for ideas? Each participant brings their own unique dish (or idea), and when combined, they create a feast of innovation! So, in this 'culinary adventure' of creativity, let's bring our best recipes (ideas) to the table and see what delicious innovations we can cook up together! (Findings of my MSc thesis)
